# TilePlatformingEngine

Greetings, the purpose of this project is to both learn and provide a robust tile platforming module created in Javascript
Version one has the basics of tile collision, just collision between a rectanglular object against rectangular tiles.
Other tile tile types will be added in the future.

As of writing this I also have turned an eye to webworks, looking to move tile based operations to exist within a worker file of sorts.
This will require heavy modification on how the system would work.

Look forward to this as the project develops. The goal being the system can be packaged and used in various projects.
